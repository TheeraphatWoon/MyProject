## üìù Overview (‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏û‡∏£‡∏ß‡∏°)

This project introduces an AI-driven system designed to detect and analyze diseases on durian leaves using object detection, providing real-time recommendations through a LINE Chatbot. Developed as a final year project for Electronics Engineering, this system aims to assist durian farmers in early disease identification and management, leveraging modern AI and communication technologies.

## ‚ú® Key Features (‡∏Ñ‡∏∏‡∏ì‡∏™‡∏°‡∏ö‡∏±‡∏ï‡∏¥‡πÄ‡∏î‡πà‡∏ô)

* **AI-Powered Disease Detection:** Utilizes YOLOv8 model for accurate identification and classification of various durian leaf diseases from uploaded images.
* **Real-time Analysis via LINE Chatbot:** Users can upload images directly to the LINE Chatbot and receive instant disease analysis and recommendations.
* **Data Management:** Implemented MySQL database for efficient storage and retrieval of disease information and user interaction data.
* **Seamless Integration:** Connects AI model with LINE Messaging API, Webhooks, and a Flask backend for robust communication and functionality.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides an intuitive experience for farmers to access agricultural insights effortlessly.
* **Cultivation Advice:** Offers practical recommendations for disease management and cultivation practices based on detection results.
